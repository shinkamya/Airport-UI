# Airport-UI
Suppose the Airport personals want to maintain records for the arrival and departure of the planes. Create a class Airport that has data like name, id, and address.
Create two more classes for Arrival and Departure implementing Airport that will have track of planes (their name, id, arrival time or departure time and a counter 
to count the number of arrivals) also include the necessary methods to access the information.

Also try to keep record of passengers by creating a new class Passenger. 
Also include a method search() in Airport class to search any passenger by name.
